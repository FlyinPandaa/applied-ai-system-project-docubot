# DocuBot


## TF Summary
The core concept students need to understand is that retrieval and generation are separate. They are separate steps that eventually lead to the desired outcome. Another things is that returning whole documents is worse than returning paragraphs, since returning whole documents will make finding the answer to queries harder. Students are most likely to struggle with building the `build_index` function, since it requires thinking about data structures which is slightly differenct than writing a for loop. AI was helpful explaining design choices and their  tradeoffs. For example, why retrieving paragraph in chunks instead of whole documents reduce the score magnitudes. Ai was misleading by  jumping into more complex solutions when the student isn't familar with what the  AI is doing. For when student is building out the major features like `build_index`, `score_document`, and `retrieve`, they will experience bugs, which can be resolved by asking the students to inspect their own data structures.


DocuBot is a small documentation assistant that helps answer developer questions about a codebase.  
It can operate in three different modes:

1. **Naive LLM mode**  
   Sends the entire documentation corpus to a Gemini model and asks it to answer the question.

2. **Retrieval only mode**  
   Uses a simple indexing and scoring system to retrieve relevant snippets without calling an LLM.

3. **RAG mode (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**  
   Retrieves relevant snippets, then asks Gemini to answer using only those snippets.

The docs folder contains realistic developer documents (API reference, authentication notes, database notes), but these files are **just text**. They support retrieval experiments and do not require students to set up any backend systems.

## Setup

### 1. Install Python dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file:

    cp .env.example .env

Then edit `.env` to include your Gemini API key:

    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

If you do not set a Gemini key, you can still run retrieval only mode.

---

## Running DocuBot

Start the program:

    python main.py

Choose a mode:

- **1**: Naive LLM (Gemini reads the full docs)  
- **2**: Retrieval only (no LLM)  
- **3**: RAG (retrieval + Gemini)

You can use built in sample queries or type your own.

---

## Running Retrieval Evaluation (optional)

    python evaluation.py

This prints simple retrieval hit rates for sample queries.

---

## Modifying the Project

You will primarily work in:

- `docubot.py`  
  Implement or improve the retrieval index, scoring, and snippet selection.

- `llm_client.py`  
  Adjust the prompts and behavior of LLM responses.

- `dataset.py`  
  Add or change sample queries for testing.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A Gemini API key for LLM features (only needed for modes 1 and 3)
- No database, no server setup, no external services besides LLM calls
